    (a) Representative model of a serpentinized rock unit that contains a center region that has been carbonated. The physical properties assigned to each unit are shown in table \ref{tab:physical-properties}. The total volume of serpentinized rock is 35 km$^3$ and carbonated rock is 15 km$^3$. Panels show the simulated (b) magnetic and (c) gravity data.
