    Physical property measurements of (a) density and (b) magnetic susceptibility of ultramafic rocks as a function of Loss On Ignition from \cite{Cutts2021}. From an LOI of 0\% to $\sim$13\%, rocks are undergoing serpentinization. Beyond an LOI of $~\sim$13\%, rock undergo carbonation. (c) Cross plot of density and magnetic susceptibility colored by Loss On Ignition (LOI).
